# Comparative Analysis: Binomial Asset Pricing Model vs. Black-Scholes Formula  

A study comparing the convergence of the Binomial Asset Pricing Model (BAPM) and the Black-Scholes (BS) formula for pricing European call options.  

## Overview  
This repository accompanies the paper **"A Comparison of the Binomial Asset Pricing Model and the Black-Scholes Formula in European Call Option Pricing"**. The study:  
- Implements both models to compute European call option prices.  
- Analyzes convergence behavior of the Binomial model toward the Black-Scholes solution.  
- Uses real-world Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data to compute volatility and validate results.  

**Key Finding**: The Binomial model converges to the Black-Scholes price at **200,000 time steps**.
